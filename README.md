Step 1: Set up the git hub
Step 2: Read in the data from excel and populate 2 maps. 1 for lyft information, 1 for uber information.
  What information will the maps hold? Each key will be the starting location. Each value will be a vector of pairs that pair will hold key as the destination and value as the price.
  Base this off of project 2- adjacency list data structure
Step 3: Read in user input and call our sorting algoritms
Step 4: Create the bubble sort code
Step 5: Create the merge sort code


USER INPUT
  User types in something like trip or random
  User types in random means they want to go somewhere, anywhere. We use bubble sort or merge sort to figure out where.
