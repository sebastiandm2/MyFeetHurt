User enters their current location in Boston. There is about a dozen 'hotspots' in the Boston area, and the user selects one amongst these. Using past ridesharing data from Uber/Lyft/cabs, we divised a program that will analyze the 10,000+ rows of this dataset to provide the user with the least expensive destination along with the most cost-efficient method of transporation. The program is backed by a graph implemented with an adjacency list using unorderedm maps in C++. The user can choose between heap sort and bubble sort to receive their recommendation.
